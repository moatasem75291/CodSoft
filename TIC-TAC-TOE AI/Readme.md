### Project Overview

In this project, I've created a Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI is designed to make optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring that it is nearly impossible to win against it.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Tic-Tac-Toe AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the game using `python main.py`.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into the following files and classes:

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the game.
- `TicTacToeGame.py`: Contains the logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `TicTacToeAI.py`: Implements the AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
- `TicTacToeGUI.py`: Builds the graphical user interface for the game.

### Usage

- Run the game using `python main.py`.
- Play the game by clicking on the empty cells in the GUI.
- The AI opponent will make its moves using the Minimax algorithm.
- Enjoy a challenging game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

### Customization

You can customize the game by adjusting the difficulty level of the AI or making changes to the GUI's appearance. Explore the code and adapt it to your preferences.

### Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for the game logic.
- PyQt5: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
- Minimax Algorithm: Employed to make the AI opponent unbeatable in the game.
