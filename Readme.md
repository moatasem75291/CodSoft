   cd CodSoft
   ```

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: The main application script that initializes the GUI and handles user interactions.
- `model.py`: Contains the chatbot model and predefined responses.
- `chatbot_gui.py`: Defines the PyQt5-based graphical user interface.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

### Usage

1. Launch the application by running `python main.py`.
2. You'll see the chatbot GUI with an input text area and a "Send" button.
3. Type your questions or messages in the input area and click "Send" to get responses from the chatbot.
4. You can also click the "Clear" button to clear the chat history.

### Customization

You can customize the chatbot responses and GUI by modifying the `model.py` and `chatbot_gui.py` files. For example, you can add more predefined responses or change the GUI's appearance.
